# Changelog

All notable changes to Offsider are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `stream-video` now emits JPEG frames in the `mjpeg`, `raw` and `ffmpeg` formats at the default `--scale` and `--quality`. Previously those frames were PNG, labelled `image/jpeg` in the `mjpeg` stream.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- `doctor` command: checks Xcode, Device Hub, CoreSimulator, HID stabilisation, the HID broker directory and booted simulators, and with `--udid` a simulator's state, Resize Mode, dtuhidd state and readiness, HID transport and accessibility. `--json` prints one object; `--fix` opens Device Hub or the device window and removes a stale broker directory. Exits 3 on warnings and 4 on failures.
- `--verify`, `--verify-timeout`, `--retries` and `--json` on `tap`, `type`, `key` and `button`: wait for an accessibility or screen change, retry (tap switches style), and exit 5 when nothing changes. Batch steps reject these flags.

### Fixed

- Input events are no longer discarded on Xcode 27. The bundled idb frameworks now wait for the simulator's HID daemon to be ready before the first event, so taps and keys land without `--post-delay`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-24

First release of Offsider, forked from [AXe](https://github.com/cameroncooke/axe) v1.8.0 by Cameron Cooke. Changes up to the fork are recorded in [AXe's changelog](https://github.com/cameroncooke/axe/blob/v1.8.0/CHANGELOG.md).

### Added

- XcodeGen project for the playground fixture app, so the simulator end-to-end suites run from a clean clone.
- Signed and notarised release tarball, `offsider-<version>-arm64.tar.gz`, with a `SHA256SUMS` file and a GitHub build provenance attestation.
- Homebrew formula in the `michael-palmes/tap` tap.

### Changed

- Renamed the tool, Swift package, targets and executable to `offsider`.
- Renamed bundle identifiers, the HID broker's runtime paths, environment variables (now `OFFSIDER_*`) and the bundled agent skill (now `offsider`).
- Builds for Apple silicon (arm64) only.
- Builds the idb frameworks from the [michael-palmes/idb](https://github.com/michael-palmes/idb) mirror at a pinned revision.

### Fixed

- Shortened HID broker socket names so they stay within the Unix socket path limit.
- Builds now honour an explicit `OFFSIDER_VERSION` when generating the version string.
